The purpose of Windows Server:
  * They house, protect, and serve up the data to be consumed by clients.
    - Everything revolves around data in business today. Our email, documents, databases,
customer listsâ€”everything that we need to do business well, is data. That data is critical to
us. Servers are what we use to build the fabric upon which we trust our data to reside.
